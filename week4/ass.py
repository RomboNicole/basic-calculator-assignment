# Program: File Read and Write with Error Handling
# Description:
# This program reads a file, modifies its content based on user's choice (uppercase or reverse lines),
# and writes the modified content into a new file. It also handles errors like file not found or unreadable files.

    if choice == '1':
        # Make all text uppercase
        return content.upper()
    elif choice == '2':
        # Reverse the lines
        lines = content.splitlines()
        reversed_lines = lines[::-1]
        return '\n'.join(reversed_lines)
    else:
        return content
